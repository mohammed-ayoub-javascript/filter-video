## Usage

1. Click the FilterVideo icon in your browser toolbar
2. Use the toggle switch to enable/disable the extension
3. Choose your preferred shortcut key
   - Default: ',' (recommended as it's close to 'm' for mute)

### Platform-Specific Behavior

#### Mainstream Platforms (YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus)

- Full functionality with keyboard shortcuts working everywhere
- Filter toggles work seamlessly
- Auto-filter option available

#### Other Platforms (iframe detection)

Important: Due to cross-origin security, there are some limitations:

- Keyboard shortcut only work when focus is outside the video frame
- To use effectively:
  1. Zoom the page if needed (two-finger gesture) but don't toggle full screen
  2. Click just outside the video frame to ensure the shortcut works
  3. Consider using a shortcut key near your device's mute button for easier control. For example, '-' is close to the mute button on Mac.

"Auto-Filter on Detection" in settings:

- Videos will automatically be filtered when detected
- Then you can toggle filter manually using the shortcut key

## Troubleshooting

### Shortcut Not Working

1. Check if extension is enabled
2. Try refreshing the page
3. If platform uses iframe, try clicking outside the iframe, and then press the shortcut key.

### Video Not Detected

1. Refresh the page
2. Disable and re-enable the extension
3. Reload the extension from chrome://extensions

### Development

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run tests:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

3. Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run package
   ```

   This will create a production build in the `dist` directory and a ZIP file ready for the Chrome Web Store.

   -> For Firefox, you need to 'mv firefox/manifest.json src/manifest.json' and then run the same command.
